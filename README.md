To call the makefile in this since I used windows I called mingw32-make and it will make the ppmrw.exe file.
For this file to work you would need a ppm image file.
Do not need an output file program will create one for you.
After the file has been created run "gcc Imagebuffer.c" to compile the code.
After that is complete run "ppmrw.exe (number you want to convert to 3 or6) inputfilename
outputfilename " to run the program.
Done
